        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>Young people have a right to have their voices heard. Technological disadvantages sometimes
            makes this difficult. Climate changes often affect marginalised communities harder and others
            around the world rarely see the impacts of their bad habits.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>The Soulution</h1>
        <p>Making a platform for receiving messages from youths without an online presence and
            presenting these to the masses online in the rich part of the world. This will help local youth
            movements making their communities getting heard by the world. The name for this platform,
            Bridger, represents making a bridge between the marginalised and offline part of the world to
            those who have access to internet.</p>

<div>
    <h1> How does it work? </h1>
    <p> Youth groups will be used to spread the concept. They can also collect messages through sms,
        email, letters and voices from youths in their communities and upload them to our platform.
        Alternatively, the children/youth can text, call, email, or send a letter directly to the database.
        In our database messages get sorted, translated and uploaded to our app.
        Users of the app vote up messages and create “hype” around the issues. We connect (local)
        charities with the users for easy donations to give back to areas of special or upvoted needs.</p>
